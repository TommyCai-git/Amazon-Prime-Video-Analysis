# Amazon-Prime-Video-Analysis
Worked on Amazon Prime data set and built a forecast model in Python to predict video view time using Python
Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessed raw sales and product data via one-hot encoding for categorical features, feature scaling for numeric features 
Built linear regression including LASSO regression and RIDGE regression, and Random Forest models and evaluated the models through several metrics such as mean square error, root mean square error, and R square
According to MSE, RMSE and R square, the Random Forest Regression has the best performance
Examined the feature importance and concluded that IMBD votes and the position of the video with the highest feature importance 0.14 and 0.12, respectively are the most influential features
